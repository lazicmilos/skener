# Contributing to SiteTriage

Thanks for your interest in SiteTriage. It scans a list of domains and ranks the sites that deserve a
full manual audit. The repository, Python package and command are still called `skener`.

> **Language.** The project started in Serbian, so most code identifiers, comments, docs, tests and
> commit history are in Serbian. Contributor-facing material is moving to English. Write new comments,
> docs, commit messages, issues and PRs in English. Translating a Serbian comment you happen to touch
> is welcome, but keep translation-only changes in their own commit, so reviewers can tell a
> translation apart from a change in behaviour. The Serbian message catalog (`skener/messages/sr.py`)
> is a product feature and stays Serbian.

## Development setup

### Docker (recommended)

The image is the official Playwright image, with exactly the Chromium revision that the pinned
`playwright` in `pyproject.toml` expects. Level 2 measurements, and the browser tests, then behave the
same on every machine. CI runs the same image.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lazicmilos/skener.git
cd skener
mkdir rad
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm skener pytest -q
```

The source is copied into the image, not mounted, so run `docker compose build` again after you change
code. Dependencies sit in their own layer, so a rebuild after a code-only change is quick. On Linux, set
`SKENER_UID=$(id -u)` and `SKENER_GID=$(id -g)` so files written to `rad/` belong to you.

### Without Docker

You need Python 3.11 or newer (CI tests 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13).

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
playwright install chromium            # on Linux add --with-deps for system libraries
```

`playwright` is pinned in the `dev` extra because each Playwright release expects one specific Chromium
revision. If you upgrade Playwright without running `playwright install chromium`, Chromium fails at
launch. The browser tests are then skipped, not failed (see [Running tests](#running-tests)).

To use a Chromium or Chrome that is already on the machine instead of Playwright's download, point
`SKENER_CHROMIUM` at the executable, or set `[browser] executable_path` in your own config file:

```bash
export SKENER_CHROMIUM=/usr/bin/chromium
```

A system browser can differ from the revision Playwright was built against. CI and the Docker image
use Playwright's own Chromium, so treat that one as the reference.

### Identity

The tool refuses to send a single request without the operator's name and contact, because every site
administrator sees them in the User-Agent. Offline tests set a placeholder identity in
`tests/conftest.py`. To scan real sites, including `pytest -m live`, set your own:

```bash
export SKENER_NAZIV="Your name or studio" SKENER_KONTAKT="you@example.com"
```

## Running tests

```bash
pytest -q                                   # offline layer, the default; CI runs this
pytest -q --cov=skener --cov-branch --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=95   # what CI runs
pytest -m live -v                           # real sites from the test set; needs network
pytest -m browser -rs                       # only level 2 tests, and why any were skipped
```

- **Offline layer** (default, `-m 'not live'` in `pyproject.toml`). No network. Checks run on
  snapshots, and the integration tests run against a local HTTP server (`tests/localserver.py`) that
  serves broken sites on purpose: slow bodies, endless streams, bot protection, sitemaps in nine
  parts. It must pass on every PR.
- **`browser` marker.** These tests need a working Chromium. `tests/conftest.py` tries to launch
  Chromium once per session and skips every `browser` test, with the reason, when Playwright is
  missing or Chromium does not start. A local skip means level 2 was not tested, so run them before
  you open a PR that touches `skener/fetch/browser.py`, `pipeline.py` or level 2 checks. CI installs
  Chromium and runs them.
- **`live` marker.** These tests hit the real domains from the test set and are off by default,
  because a site's expired certificate is not a defect in the tool. Run them by hand when you change
  fetching or calibration.
- **Coverage gate.** CI fails if line and branch coverage drops below 95 %.
- **Mutation testing** measures whether the tests notice changes in behaviour. mutmut only works on
  Linux and takes about 20 minutes, so it runs through Docker:

  ```bash
  docker compose run --rm skener python scripts/mutacije.py
  ```

  Which modules are mutated is set in `[tool.mutmut]` in `pyproject.toml`. mutmut 3.2.3 does not
  mutate functions with decorators, so check bodies (`@check`) are not covered by it. Run it when you
  change scoring, address classification, parsing or other pure logic, and say in the PR if a new
  mutant survives.

### Test design conventions

- The baseline is a clean site on which no check may find anything. Each positive test breaks exactly
  one thing and asserts that no other check woke up.
- Thresholds get boundary value tests (limit − 1, limit, limit + 1), and rules with several
  conditions get decision tables.
- The technique is in the test case id: `gv-` boundary value, `ke-` equivalence class, `tab-` decision
  table, `st-` state transition, `pg-` error guessing. See `tests/test_granice.py` for examples.
- Fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` are hand-written, not recorded from real sites.

## Lint and pre-commit

```bash
ruff check skener/ tests/ scripts/
```

Rules and line length (110) are in `[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml`. The code base is not formatted
with `ruff format`, so do not reformat files you are not otherwise changing.

The repository has a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration with `ruff check --fix` and a
few basic file hygiene hooks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files                  # optional, once
```

## Architecture rules

These rules are what make the tool testable without a network and its reports defensible. A PR that
breaks one of them will not be merged, however useful the feature.

1. **Checks never touch the network.** Code that fetches and code that draws conclusions are separate
   layers. A check receives a snapshot that was already collected and returns results. `skener/checks/`
   does not import `httpx`, `playwright`, `skener.fetch` (except `skener.fetch.urls`),
   `skener.pipeline`, `skener.messages` or `skener.report`. If a check needs something from the
   network, the snapshot is missing a field: add the field to the snapshot instead.
2. **Phase order lives only in `skener.pipeline`** ([ADR-008](docs/adr/ADR-008-pipeline.md)). `cli`
   does not import `fetch.http`, `fetch.browser` or `score`. Both rules are enforced by
   `tests/test_arhitektura.py`.
3. **Thresholds live in `skener.toml`, not in code.** Read them through the check context
   (`ctx.th("thresholds.perf.html_size_kb")`). A threshold change comes with its reasoning in
   `docs/kalibracija.md` and, for user-visible ones, in the README table of thresholds.
4. **Every check returns one of four states**: `ok`, `finding`, `unknown` or `not_applicable`. Use the
   helpers in `skener/checks/registry.py`. `unknown` and `not_applicable` require a reason code. A
   check that could not verify something says `unknown`. It never reports `ok` for something it did
   not see, and never crashes on an older snapshot that lacks a field.
5. **Findings carry evidence, not sentences.** Evidence is data: numbers, URLs and technical codes.
   The sentence is built from it at display time by the catalogs in `skener/messages/`
   ([ADR-009](docs/adr/ADR-009-katalog-poruka.md)).
6. **Client-facing sentences claim only what was measured.** Every number in a sentence comes from
   the evidence, and numbers agree with nouns in both languages. A sentence must exist in **both**
   `skener/messages/sr.py` and `skener/messages/en.py`, and the English one claims exactly what the
   Serbian one claims, no more and no less. `tests/test_poruke.py` enforces this.
7. **Politeness and safety guarantees are not negotiable.** One request at a time per site, a pause
   between requests (longer if `Crawl-delay` asks for it), `robots.txt` `Disallow` respected, a hard
   budget per domain, giving up on `429`/`503`, an operator identity in every request, and no private
   or special addresses ([ADR-006](docs/adr/ADR-006-ssrf.md)). There is no global switch that turns
   these off, and a PR must not add one.
8. **No real lead lists or scan results in the repository.** Domain lists, per-domain results and
   snapshots of real sites stay out of git, issues and PRs.

## Adding a new check

1. **Register it.** Add a function with the `@check(...)` decorator in the module for its category
   under `skener/checks/` (`seo.py`, `perf.py`, ...). Give it a `check_id` of the form
   `category.subject.problem`, its level, base severity, the snapshot parts it `requires`, a short
   description and the threshold in words. The registry feeds the engine, the README table and
   `skener explain` from one place.
2. **Put the threshold in `skener.toml`** under `[thresholds.<category>]` and read it with `ctx.th`.
3. **Return all states deliberately**: `finding(...)` with evidence, `ok(...)`, and `unknown(...)` or
   `not_applicable(...)` with a reason code whenever the input does not allow a verdict.
4. **Write the messages** in both `skener/messages/sr.py` and `skener/messages/en.py`: a `FINDINGS`
   entry with the client and technical sentence, and an entry in `REASONS` for every new reason code.
   The catalog and the registry must have the same keys.
5. **Test it.**
   - Add the check to `POZITIVNI` in `tests/test_checks_level1.py` or `tests/test_checks_level2.py`
     (one broken thing, only this check fires). The clean-site tests fail until you do.
   - Add boundary value tests (`gv-`) for every threshold and a decision table (`tab-`) if the rule
     has several conditions, in `tests/test_granice.py`.
   - Add message cases to `tests/poruke_slucajevi.py`, including the plural forms.
   - Add an `unknown` / `not_applicable` case for each reason the check can give.
6. **Update the README table.** Run `skener explain --all --markdown` and paste the result over the
   table of checks in `README.md`. CI fails if a registered `check_id` is missing from the README.
7. **Calibrate.** Use `skener recheck <snapshots> --config <trial.toml> --out <dir>` on saved
   snapshots to see what the new check would report, without fetching sites again.
8. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** (see below). A new check changes `config_digest` and adds findings that
   users will see.

## Changing `report.json`

`report.json` is a contract for programs (the web app, `skener diff`, CRMs). Its shape is described by
`skener/schema/report-2.json`, which ships with the package. The rules are in
[ADR-011](docs/adr/ADR-011-json-sema.md):

- The schema rejects unknown fields, so a new field goes into the schema in the **same commit** as the
  model change. The tests validate the output against the schema.
- An added field raises the minor version (`2.0` → `2.1`), because an older reader can skip it.
- A removed field, a changed type or meaning, or a renamed `check_id` raises the major version
  (`2.x` → `3.0`), and is listed under breaking changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Snapshots are internal and may change, as long as `skener recheck` still reads old ones. A check
  that misses a field introduced later returns `unknown` with a reason, never `ok` and never a crash.

## Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in English:

```
fix(BUG-030): count a repeated oversized image once
feat: compare two runs with skener diff
docs: explain level 2 limits in ADR-006
```

- Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `ci`, `chore`.
- The scope is optional. Use it for a requirement or bug id (`Z-33`, `BUG-030`) when there is one.
- Mark breaking changes with `!` (`feat(Z-30)!: ...`). A breaking change is anything that changes a
  domain status, a `check_id`, the shape of a finding or `report.json`. It is recorded in
  `CHANGELOG.md` under breaking changes **in the same commit**.
- Keep commits focused. Formatting, translation and behaviour changes go in separate commits.

## Pull requests

- Open an issue first for a new check, a new dependency or a change to the report format, so the
  direction is agreed before you write code.
- One logical change per PR. Fill in the PR template.
- CI must be green: lint, tests on all supported Python versions, coverage gate, README table, and
  the Docker build.
- Add tests that fail without your change. For a bug fix, the test reproduces the bug.
- User-visible changes get an entry in the "Unreleased" section of `CHANGELOG.md`.
- If a client-facing sentence changes, change it in both languages and regenerate the golden files in
  `tests/golden/` in the same commit, so the difference is visible in `git diff`.
- Describe how you verified the change: which tests, and for fetching or level 2 changes, whether you
  ran `-m browser`, `-m live` or a `recheck`.
- Do not post private domains, lead lists or unredacted snapshots in a PR or issue.

## Reporting problems

- Bugs, wrong findings and missed problems: use the issue templates. For a wrong finding, attach the
  relevant part of `report.json` or a snapshot with the domain anonymized.
- Security vulnerabilities: do **not** open a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
